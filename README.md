## Project Files Overview

This repository contains all notebooks and resources used for the DL & GenAI Project (Roll: 23f1001572). The primary notebook **dl-23f1001572-notebook-t32025.ipynb** includes the complete inference pipeline for all three models: Scratch BiLSTM, RoBERTa-Large Transformer, and TF-IDF + LightGBM.  
 
Model-specific training notebooks are organized separately:
- **roberta-large.ipynb** – Fine-tuning the RoBERTa-Large transformer model for multi-label emotion classification.  
- **scratch-bilstm-model (1).ipynb** – Implementation and training of a custom BiLSTM model built from scratch.  
- **tfidf-lgbm.ipynb** – Classical ML pipeline using TF-IDF vectorization with LightGBM classifiers.

These notebooks together demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, W&B experiment tracking, and final Kaggle-ready inference.
